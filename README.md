## It's drawing japanese candle stick chart from financial data.

### To achieve clarity it has bigger level of customisation.

### Optimised for small screen ⠀ or ⠀ huge needs  <br> It can display one candle per one pixel column <br> ⠀ and ⠀  per two pixel column — which is already very distinguishable.

### It's achieved by omitting candles framework <br> in need to unattach sizes of candles, sizes of their shadows, and sizes of spaces in between <br> ⠀ as well as ⠀ thickness of strokes — separatelly for body and shadows <br> ⠀ and at last ⠀ colors of all of those. <br> And yes — it wasn't separated ! ! !
